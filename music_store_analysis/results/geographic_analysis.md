**Business Insight**: Rock music dominates as the most popular genre across almost all countries, with only Argentina showing a preference for Alternative & Punk. This global popularity of rock music suggests that the store should maintain a strong focus on rock music in its inventory and marketing strategies. However, the varying purchase volumes across countries indicate different market sizes and opportunities. Countries like the USA, Canada, Brazil, and France represent the largest markets for rock music and should be prioritized for marketing campaigns and inventory allocation.

## Q15: Most Popular Countries for Music Purchases

The countries with the highest purchase counts are:

| Country | Purchase Count | Total Sales |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| USA | 1040 | $523.06 |
| Canada | 535 | $303.96 |
| France | 449 | $227.31 |

| Portugal | 205 | $84.70 |
| India | 183 | $75.26 |
| Chile | 146 | $46.62 |

**Business Insight**: The USA is by far the largest market, with nearly twice the purchase count of the second-largest market (Canada) and more than double the sales revenue. The top five countries (USA, Canada, France, Brazil, and Germany) account for a significant portion of total sales, suggesting that these markets should be prioritized for marketing efforts, customer support, and localized content. The disparity between purchase count and total sales in some countries (e.g., Brazil has more purchases than France but lower total sales) indicates different purchasing patterns or price sensitivities across markets, which could inform regional pricing or promotion strategies.
