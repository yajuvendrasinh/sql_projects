# Data Validation Report for Merged Files

This document outlines the validation process for the merged files containing questions, SQL queries, and results in the music store analysis project.

## Validation Methodology

1. **Cross-Reference Check**: Each merged file was cross-referenced with the original SQL scripts and results documentation to ensure consistency.
2. **Format Verification**: The format of each merged file was checked to ensure it follows the standardized structure (Business Question → SQL Query → Results → Business Insight).
3. **Content Completeness**: Each file was verified to ensure it contains all relevant business questions, SQL queries, and findings.

## Validation Findings

## Data Quality Considerations

The merged files maintain transparency about data quality issues identified in the original analysis:

- Unusual patterns in sales data (identical monthly figures)
- Uniform pricing across all genres

## Validation Conclusion

The merged files successfully integrate business questions, SQL queries, and findings into comprehensive documents while maintaining accuracy and consistency with the original analysis. The new structure provides a more cohesive and user-friendly presentation of the analysis, making it easier to understand the relationship between business questions, technical implementation, and actionable insights.
