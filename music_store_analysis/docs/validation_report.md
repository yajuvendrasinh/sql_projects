# Data Validation Report

This document outlines the validation process for the music store analysis project, ensuring data accuracy and consistency between SQL queries and reported results.

## Validation Methodology

1. **Cross-Reference Check**: Each SQL query was cross-referenced with its corresponding results documentation to ensure consistency.
2. **Data Quality Assessment**: Identified data quality issues were documented and their impact on analysis results was evaluated.
3. **Anomaly Investigation**: Unusual patterns in the data were investigated to determine whether they represent actual business patterns or data limitations.

## Validation Findings

### Data Quality Issues

1. **Missing Values**: 
   - Customer table: 130 missing values (primarily in optional fields like company, fax)
   - Employee table: 1 missing value
   - Invoice table: 359 missing values (primarily in optional fields like billing_state)
   - Track table: 978 missing values (primarily in composer field)

   **Impact Assessment**: These missing values do not significantly impact the core analysis as they are in optional fields and do not affect the primary key and foreign key relationships.

### Unusual Patterns Validated

1. **Consistent Monthly Sales**: The identical monthly sales figures in 2009 were confirmed to be accurate based on the data provided. This pattern suggests either a data limitation or a business model with highly predictable, subscription-like purchasing patterns.

2. **Uniform Pricing**: The consistent $0.99 pricing across all genres was confirmed to be accurate, reflecting the store's standardized pricing strategy.

### Query Validation

All SQL queries were executed successfully and produce results consistent with the documented findings. The following specific validations were performed:

1. **Employee Hierarchy (Q1)**: Confirmed that Andrew Adams is the most senior employee with level L6.

2. **Country Invoice Counts (Q2)**: Verified that the USA has the highest invoice count (131), followed by Canada (76) and Brazil (61).

3. **Top Customers (Q5)**: Confirmed that R Madhav and Frank Harris are the highest-spending customers, both with $144.54 in total purchases.

4. **Artist Popularity (Q12)**: Verified that Iron Maiden is the most purchased artist with 140 purchases.

5. **Geographic Analysis (Q15)**: Confirmed that the USA is the largest market with $523.06 in total sales.

## Validation Conclusion

The analysis results are consistent with the underlying data and SQL queries. The identified data quality issues do not significantly impact the core findings and have been transparently documented. The unusual patterns observed in the data appear to be accurate reflections of the provided dataset, though they suggest areas for further investigation in a real-world business context.

This validation confirms that the analysis provides a reliable foundation for business decision-making while acknowledging the limitations of the available data.
